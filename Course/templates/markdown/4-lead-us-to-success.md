Setting up an ECG required us to place 6 chest leads and 4 limb leads. How does this generate 12 leads on the trace that we interpret? Let's have a look.

The leads can be split into 3 categories:
Standard limb leads (bipolar): I, II and III
Augmented leads (unipolar): aVR, aVL and aVF
Precordial leads: V1-V6

The 3 standard limb leads can be explained using Einthoven's triangle. The triangle consists of the electrodes at the right arm, left arm and left leg

As we can see, the right arm is taken as the negative electrode in leads I and II. The left arm is taken as the negative electrode in lead III. 
These leads are bipolar, and they measure electrical activity in the positive direction. If the average cardiac vector is towards the left leg in lead II, then the trace will show a positive deflection. 

Our understanding of vectors shows us that the resultant vector represented by lead II is equal to the sum of lead I and lead III according to Einthoven's triangle. Let's test it out.
