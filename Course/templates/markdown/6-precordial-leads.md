Precordial leads (V1-V6) are also unipolar. They act as the positive electrode and therefore also require a reference point for the negative electrode. This is where Wilson's Central Terminal is introduced

Wilson's Central Terminal

Wilson's Central terminal uses the average between the LA, RA and LL electrodes. It tells us about the electrical activity towards the middle of the heart. The chest electrodes are then compared against it.

The chest electrodes are orientated to produce a view of the heart in the transverse plane. You may have noticed that in a standard 12 Lead ECG, the posterior heart is not directly measured. If pathology is suspected posteriorly, 3 additional chest electrodes can be attached (V7-V9).
