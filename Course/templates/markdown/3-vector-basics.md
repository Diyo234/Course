I know I know. Maths was left the day we sat our GCSEs. But reminding ourselves of some of the basics of vectors will allow us to better grasp the concepts of ECGs. It wonâ€™t take long I promise.

A vector can be represented as a line which has a direction depicted with an arrow, and a fixed size. Here is our example vector a:





Another useful property of vectors that we should be aware of is the ability to project a vector onto a plane. This essentially means that we can find out how much of an impact a vector will have in a certain direction.

Later on we'll look at the various leads and cardiac axis and so on. But for now, we can use lead I and aVF

Our first principle that we covered about vectors tells us that a + b = c. Our projection principle is what produced a and b. It represents the size of the cardiac vector on the plane formed by lead I and likewise in lead aVF. Our point in the ECG trace may look something like this:


So that's it! These principles will help us to understand and visualise ECGs as we move through the course. Onwards and upwards!
