### What is an ECG?
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a recording of a heart's electrical activity, which changes throughout the cardiac cycle. Electrodes placed on the chest and on the limbs allow the reading to be obtained. As you know, it is an extremely useful tool in the diagnosis of heart conditions, and identifying abnormalities. 

### The Standard ECG

The standard ECG consists of 12 leads. Half of the leads are precordial leads that are placed on the chest, 3 of the leads are limb leads and the final 3 are augmented leads. The differing location of the leads allow for different angles of the heart to be observed.

*A standard ECG. V1-V6 are chest leads, I, II and III are limb leads and aVR, aVL and aVF are augmented leads*

An ECG can be understood to be numerous graphs represented within the same space. It may perhaps be more intuitive to isolate one of the leads.

The trace displays the change in voltage as time elapses. As labelled, each large division represents 0.2 seconds, meaning that each small division represents 0.04 seconds. Along the y axis, each large division represents 0.5 mV and each small division represents 0.1 mV.





An ECG is split into numerous waves. We will look in to the significance of each as we progress. For now, the trace below labels each of the components

### Calculating heart rates
There are 2 ways that we generally calculate heart rate:

1.    We can find the time between 2 consecutive R waves (the main spike of a QRS complex). As heart rate is measured in beats per minute, we divide 60 by the RR interval.

    Example:
    This method is a more accurate way of calculating heart rate. However, it may not be suitable in some instances such as when there is an irregular heartbeat.

2.    We can count the number of QRS complexes in a given time.
    For this method, we usually take Lead II as our rhythm strip. Below Lead II is shown over 10 seconds.

    After counting 10 QRS complexes, we multiply this value by 6 to get an estimated heart rate of 60 bpm.
    This is a quicker but often less accurate method. It can be useful when the heartbeat is irregular.

We have introduced the concept of electrocardiograms and we now have an idea of what the various parts represent. Next we will look at how to practically obtain a 12 lead ECG trace - OSCE style.
