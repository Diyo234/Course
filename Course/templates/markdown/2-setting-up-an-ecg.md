After washing our hands (of course) and introducing ourselves to the patient, we would ensure to explain what an ECG is. Something along the lines of " I'd like to record an ECG reading which will tell us about the electrical activity of the heart. This would involve placing sticky pads on your chest and limbs. These pads will be connected to a machine which will give us our trace." would suffice.

We'd also need to ask the patient if they are comfortable exposing their chest. We may also need a razor if a patient is particularly hairy and we are struggling to fix the pads in place.


We then apply the 6 chest electrodes in their appropriate locations as represented by the Figure X. The exact placement is as follows:
V1 - 4th intercostal space, right sternal edge
V2 - 4th intercostal space, left sternal edge
V3 - halfway between V2 and V4
V4 - 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
V5 - level with V4, anterior axillary line
V6 - level with V4, midaxillary line



The limb lead locations are:
Red : right forearm, proximal to the wrist           RIDE
Yellow: left forearm, proximal to the wrist         YOUR
Green: left lower leg, proximal to the ankle       GREEN
Black: right lower leg, proximal to the ankle       BIKE

We then turn our machine on, ask for the patient to relax and remain as still as possible. And there we have it. Obtaining an ECG trace in a nutshell.

If you want to spend more time on the practical aspects of ECGs, the following resources may tickle your fancy

Question: Where is V2 placed?
How many augmented leads are in a standard 12 lead ECG?
How many large divisions would represent 1 second on an ECG trace?

We have introduced the concept of ECGs, and we have looked at how we might set up an ECG in real life. Letâ€™s have a look at how to begin interpreting the trace.
