Augmented leads are unipolar; a single positive electrode is taken at the corresponding limb electrode. The negative electrode is formed from the remaining limb electrodes. We can take aVF as an example.

For aVF, our positive electrode is found on the left leg. Our negative electrode is the mean between the electrodes on the right and left arms. We can actually produce aVF using the values on the ECG trace for leads I, II and III as shown below.

Our 3 augmented leads and our 3 bipolar standard limb leads complete the frontal plane view of the heart. We require our precordial leads to view the heart in the transverse plane.

The angles formed by all of the limb leads. aVR, aVL and aVF are 60 degrees from each other forming 3 points on an equilateral triangle. Lead I forms our reference point at 0 and leads II and III are also 60 degrees from one another.

Question: Which limb electrodes allow us to form lead III?
